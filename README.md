Change Kata
==========

I was inspired at the 2012 [SCNA](http://scna.softwarecraftsmanship.org/) conference to do the change [kata](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kata_\(programming\)) in node.js.

The goal of the change kata is to return the minimum amount of change given an amount.

For instance:

    99

should return:

    3 quarters, 2 dimes & 4 pennies

There are 10 commits in this project representing the process I went through to complete this kata.

Clone and play. Let me know if you see room for improvements.

To run the tests:

    make
